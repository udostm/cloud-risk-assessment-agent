## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Make**: For running make commands.
- **Docker**: Version 2 or later.

Set up your inference endpoint using [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/trendmicro-ailab/Llama-Primus-Merged):
- **Recommended Inference Endpoint**: [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/)
- **Recommended GPU**: At least L40s
- **Context Length**: 128k tokens
* [SGLang Setup Guide](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/c550e52f8bcaaafeeaa41e5aac943a767f4d20b2/docs/references/nvidia_jetson.md) (use --contex-length parameter)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the code from the Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trendmicro/cloud-risk-assessment-agent
```

### 2. Prepare the Environment File

Create a new `.env` file in the root directory of the repository and copy the following contents into it:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://huggingface.co/trendmicro-ailab/Llama-Primus-Merged?local-app=vllm
OPENAI_API_KEY="trendmicro-ailab/Llama-Primus-Merged"
OPENAI_MODEL=Primus-Christmas-128k
SERVICE_HOST=http://localhost
POSTGRES_USER=tmcybertron
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=tmcybertron

```

### 3. Build & Start Server

To start the server:

```bash
# Enter the code folder
make run
```

### 4. Scan Your Code / Container / Kubernetes / AWS

Use this command to configure agent scan settings. You can specify which resources should be scanned.
Find more detailed instructions [here](docs/Scan.md).

```bash
make gen_config
